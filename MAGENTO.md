## Prerequisites

-  To use the PL Search Engine you will need an active PL account. If you donâ€™t have an account you can sign up [here](https://partslogic.com/pricing/](https://partslogic.com/request-demo/)). See plans and pricing [here](https://partslogic.com/pricing/).
- Create the required API key for the PartsLogic ETL process in the Admin Panel, this step is typically executed by our developers once the API is ready.

## REST API

For Magento, PartsLogic needs the following RESTful API to provide you with optimized search experience:

- Get products endpoint 
- Get Categories enpoint 
- For fitments PL needs CSV file that includes (PRODUCT_ID, Year, Make, Model)


## Install PL Javascript Library

First thing first, we need to install the following libraries:
- [React dom](https://unpkg.com/react-dom@17.0.2/umd/react-dom.production.min.js)
- [React](https://unpkg.com/react@17/umd/react.production.min.js)
- [PartsLogic](https://unpkg.com/@partslogic/ui@0.0.17-alpha.0/build/index.umd.js)

after installing the above libraries, navigate to your Magento app `app/design/frontend/<Theme Name>/theme/web/js` and upload the above files so we can access them in the next step

## Install PL CSS
This template follows a very simple project structure:
- `src`: This folder is the main container of all the code inside your application.
  - `api`: This folder contains all endpoints that are used in the app.
  - `assets`: Asset folder to store all images, vectors, etc.
  - `components`: Folder that contains all resuable application components.
